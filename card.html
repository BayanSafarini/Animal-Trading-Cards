			<p class="interesting-fact">The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and
				considered a national treasure in China.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><span>scientific name</span>: Ailuropoda melanoleuca</li>
				<li><span>height</span>: Adults can grow to more than four feet.</li>
				<li><span>weight</span>: 220-330 pounds</li>
				<li><span>habitats</span>: Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of southwest China</li>
			</ul>

			<p>A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter-about 1/900th the size of its mother-but females
				can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears are
				excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.</p>
